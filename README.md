The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers. In this project, tabu search algorithm used for deliver shipments to customers with minimum cost.
